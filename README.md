## Todo
**Important**
- [ ] Make into dockspace
- [ ] Write wireframe for the visualizer, maybe a scrub bar for the rosbag images
- [ ] Finish up the rosbag inspector to see the topics
- [ ] Change basalt-headers to be using 8 bit instead of 16 bit, so no need for conversion.

**Not important**
- [ ] Change glfw to submodule dependency instead.

## Trouble shooting stuff
- NFDE library changed from nativefiledialog-extended to ..._extended to be valid for cmake (hyphen in name not valid)
- #define IMGUI_DEFINE_MATH_OPERATORS error, most likely an error in the order with which things have been imported
  - Forked immvision and pushed changes to repo to quick fix the include headers in src_all_in_one.h
- Segmentation faults -> More often then not it's got something to do with uninitialized vectors and ImGui library.
- Use develop branch for most vilota repos
- basalt-sqrt does not build on macos, the original basalt does, mirror as well.

## Setup

mkdir build && cd build
